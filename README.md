make mechanized unlock 1939
artillery/SPART SA needs to be nerfed almost certainly
lower exp cost for divisional changes
increase cost of forts
resource rebalance
war justification for comintern/axis, change threat levels
supply to planes
add variant production cost increase
add variants for infantry weapons/artillery

nerf maintenance company

add proximity fuze technology


Notes about breakthrough
Breakthrough is a measure of ability to reduce damage while on the attack. Mobility is a factor. Armor advantage is separate.
LARM should have similar/equal breakthrough to MARM.
breakthrough is fine for now.

Soft attack
boost soft attack 1.5x for infantry base equipment
lower artillery soft attack from 30/40/50 to base 20/30/40

armor discussion

3:04 PM - Sqwerlpunk: the main difference is in their intended targets, and what they're vulnerable to
3:04 PM - Sqwerlpunk: LARM should be hunting infantry, and should fucking excel at it
3:05 PM - Sqwerlpunk: but they should fear any sort of heavier armor
3:05 PM - Sqwerlpunk: LARM vs LARM is a question of "who is attacking?"
3:05 PM - Sqwerlpunk: ARM is good at infantry, but their real benefit is that they fuck LARM
3:06 PM - Sqwerlpunk: they ofc fear HARM
3:06 PM - Sqwerlpunk: ARM should be quite capable of defending LARM attack (armor advantage)
3:06 PM - Sqwerlpunk: ARM v ARM is same as LARM
3:06 PM - Sqwerlpunk: repeat for HARM except they aren't that good at infantry anymore, because they've traded in for armor out the ass and big guns (but still have armor advantage, so inf still can't touch them)
